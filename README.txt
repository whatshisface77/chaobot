---***WELCOME TO CHAOBOT***---
This bot was created to automatically run a 'Track of the Day' system for Sonic Robo-Blast 2 Kart. What exactly IS a 'Track of the Day' system? Well, here's how it works:


**1.)** At the beginning of the day (6:00am), a message will be sent by the bot in the *#totd-track* channel. This message will contain one track and one character.
**2.)** Your goal as a player is to go into the 'Time Trial' mode of SRB2K, select the stage designated by the bot's message, select the character also designated by the bot (any color is fine), and try to get the fastest time possible.
**3.)** The challenge lasts until 11:59pm that night. If you get a time that you like, you can go into the *#totd-track* channel and use the *!submit* command to submit your time, along with a screenshot of your time in-game. This time will then be stored in the daily leaderboards.
**4.)** At the end of the day, the user at the top of the leaderboards with the fastest time is declared the winner! They win exactly 1 point on the overall leaderboard, and the track and leaderboards are reset at 6:00am the next day.


Simple, right? Here are some details about the commands so you know how to operate them:


**!submit**: Use this command to submit your time to the daily leaderboards. It is this exact command, followed by your total time in EXACTLY THIS FORMAT => 00:00:00
ex.) !submit 03:56:72, !submit 01:05:07, !submit 00:10:44
**!leaderboard**: Use this, exactly as it is typed here, to view the leaderboards for the day. They are reset at the end of the current day, and in order to enter the leaderboards of any given day, you must submit a time.
**!current**: Allows you to view the current 'Track of the Day' rules, including the course that is used and the character you play as.


**EXTRA RULES:**
**1.)** Please ONLY PUT COMMANDS in the *#totd-track* channel. You can forward any questions, suggestions, or additional comments to the *#totd-discussion* channel.
**2.)** I am not a miracle worker, and this bot is not perfect. It cannot check in the moment if you're using the right character, playing on the right course, etc. We are working on an honor system here, so whenever you submit your time to the daily leaderboards, ***INCLUDE A SCREENSHOT OF YOUR TIME FROM THE GAME!*** Here are some examples of acceptable screenshots:

*example*

If you submit a time without the proper screenshots or any evidence whatsoever, I (Whatshisface) will be sure to remove your invalid time from the board and will throw you in cheating baby jail. 
**3.)** Please do not try to purposely break the bot by spamming commands or through any other means. I worked hard on it : (
If you find any *legitimate bugs*, you can find out what I would like you to do below.
**4.)** This goes without saying but just don't be a real dickhead. Please feel free to be competitive and have fun, but don't take things too far and start name-calling other players or falsely accusing others of cheating. We're all here to have fun so don't act like this is a life-or-death situation.


**NOTES:**
- You do not have to participate in every 'Track of the Day' that occurs. You will only be tracked on a daily leaderboard if you submit a time during that day.
- You may experience some bugs while using this bot. If anything strange occurs, please relay this information to the *#totd-bugs* channel. I will be sure to check that space often and fix any problems that arise.
- This bot is still in development. If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to let me (Whatshisface) know, as I am more than willing to hear any additional notes about this program.
- Have fun or die.
